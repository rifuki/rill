/// Rill agent wallet — an on-chain, capped, revocable budget for an AI agent, gated by a composable
/// set of owner-attached restriction rules.
///
/// v3 redesign: replaces v2's hardcoded `spend()` asserts (flat budget/per-tx/window/allowed-packages
/// fields baked into the wallet struct) with the Sui Kiosk `TransferPolicy` **Rule + Hot Potato**
/// pattern. `request_spend` mints a `SpendRequest` — a hot potato with NO abilities (no `drop`,
/// `store`, `key`, or `copy`) — carrying the spend's metadata. Every rule attached to the wallet's
/// `SpendPolicy` must stamp a receipt onto the request (via its own `prove` entry, which checks its
/// invariant then calls `add_receipt`) before `confirm_spend` will unpack the potato and release the
/// coin. This is unbypassable by construction: a `SpendRequest` with abilities `{}` cannot be dropped,
/// stored, or discarded — the transaction can only succeed by routing it through `confirm_spend`,
/// which asserts every attached rule's receipt is present.
///
/// Rules are independent modules (`agent_wallet::budget`, `::per_tx`, `::rate_limit`, `::time_window`)
/// that attach their config as a dynamic field on `SpendPolicy`, keyed by their own witness type —
/// mirroring `sui::transfer_policy::add_rule`. Because rule configs live in dynamic fields rather than
/// `AgentWallet`/`SpendPolicy` struct fields, new rule types ship via in-place package upgrade
/// (guarded by `agent_wallet::version`) without ever touching the wallet's struct layout — no forced
/// redeploy.
///
/// Owner-only surface: `add_rule`/`remove_rule` (and every setter) assert `ctx.sender() == owner`.
/// The agent holds only an `AgentCap`, which authorizes `request_spend` within whatever rules are
/// currently composed — it can never see or touch `add_rule`/`remove_rule` (R4: the agent can never
/// change its own restrictions).
///
/// **Version gate scope — an upgrade can pause the agent, but must never trap the owner.**
/// `agent_wallet::version::check_is_valid` gates `create_wallet` and the agent-facing spend path
/// (`request_spend`/`confirm_spend`, and every rule's `prove`) — so an in-place upgrade can pause new
/// spending until `migrate` runs. It deliberately does NOT gate any owner-only op (`revoke`, `top_up`,
/// `rotate_agent`, `extend_expiry`, `add_rule`, `remove_rule`): if the owner's emergency controls —
/// above all `revoke`, the kill-switch that reclaims funds — required a fresh `Version` too, a stale
/// shared `Version` object between an upgrade and its `migrate` call would fund-trap the owner out of
/// their own wallet. Owner ops stay live across any package version; only the agent's ability to move
/// money is what an upgrade can pause.
///
/// This is a fresh package (struct layout changed from v2; Sui upgrade compatibility forbids changing
/// existing struct fields in-place), so v3 ships as a new deploy rather than an upgrade of v2.
